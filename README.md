Analysis

The purpose of the following analysis is to measure the results of Capomulin used  by Pymaceuticals Inc. and the effects on tumor development on mice in comparison to other drugs regimens.  The records analyzed are the effects on the mice on the course of 45 days.
These are some of the conclusions following the data collected:
- A total of 249 mice were studied out of them 50.7% are male mice and 49.3% female.
- When comparing the drug treatments on Capolulin	Ramicane,	Infubinol and Ceftamin both Capomulin and Ramicane have best results sustainded on reducing the size of the tumors on the 45 days period.
- Following drug treatment using Capomulin  on mouse identified as l509 we can see a reduction on the tumor size after day 20.
- The weight seems to be a driver for the tumor volume, considering that every mice should have the same opportunity to gain weight and avoid bias in the research.
